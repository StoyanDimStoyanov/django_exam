Python web framework exam December 2020
The project is Olx.bg alike (not pixel perfect), site where you can sell things.
The site has public part with all announces and a search bar with autocomplete witch use jqueryUi library.(works from the second symbol)
For the rest of the site the user needs registration.
Future improvements CBViews instead of FBV's
https://djangoapp101.herokuapp.com/ heroku deletes often the media files so it's quite possible you can not see the pictires of the products.
## **If you try to delete announcement or change a picture already deleted by heroku:**
>No such file or directory: 'media/images/...'

**error will be displayed.**
